## Introduction

The Stock Price Prediction project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis and prediction of stock prices using various machine learning and deep learning models. This can help investors make informed decisions based on historical data.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and creating datasets.
- Machine Learning: Implementing Linear Regression for prediction.
- Deep Learning: Using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for more accurate predictions.
- Visualization: Plotting actual vs predicted stock prices.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/incrediblebug20/stock_price.git
cd stock_price
```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**

```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install the required dependencies**

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Place your stock data file (`stock_data.csv`) in the `data` directory.**

## Usage

1. **Run the data preparation script**

```sh
python src/data_preparation.py
```

2. **Run the model training script**

```sh
python src/model_training.py
```

3. **View the predictions and plots**

The predictions and plots will be displayed in a pop-up window or saved in the specified directory as per the scripts.
